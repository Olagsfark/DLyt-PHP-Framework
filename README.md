## Documentation
### Framework Structure
  Not available yet
### Functions and Classes reference
  Not available yet  
### Overview
  Most of the documentation isn't ready yet(Please bare with). 
  Work is seriously going on with the creation of documentations starting from the functions and class references. 
  If you check the codes, you'll discover the codes aren't well documented at all.
  
### How to: Experimental Usage

**The framework in its current form is ready for experimental use.**
- Clone the source tree on your local server
- Run the index.php file in the root folder
  - You should have a template powered page starring at you right now.

The app folder contains the model, view, and handler components which are divided into folders. The equivalent view, model, and handler scripts make up a complete app. E.g. For a homepage app, the app structure could be like:
  - *handler/home.handler.php*
  - *model/home.model.php*
  - *view/home.view.php*

The view component is the first component that will be accessed on app request. Hence the view component can standalone with only html data incases where you don't need any dynamic php content. 
In cases where a web service is needed, you can simply create a handler and point to it in the settings.

> More on this documentation will be written, Its still confusing to you for now.

## Advantage
### Easy! dlyt PHP framework is designed for those that need a very fast php framework that will manage their code in a way that it doesn't introduce them to new PHP syntax nor API nor code organizations that involve a steep learning curve.
### Security! Yea, Its really closed and secure.

The framework is well defended against major web vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection, CSRF and many under the hood. The framework was designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind. With its plugin system, you can easily create features that would integrate tightly with the framework without causing a glitch in performance(Terms and conditions apply).

## Partnership and collaboration
This framework is a very promising one with amazing simplicity as compared to other major frameworks around. Collaborators and participant would be greatly appreciated as the framework is currently being built and maintained by only one person. 
Also documentators would be greatly needed as the best software is the one with the best documentation.
